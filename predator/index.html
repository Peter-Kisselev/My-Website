        But, there is a twist. In predators the classic cells that are alive are
        called prey, and there is a new type of cell: the predator cell. While
        the prey is the same as a living cell in the game of life, the predator
        cells are a completely different story. A predator cell will move
        randomly around the board until it spots at least one prey cell, then it
        randomly eats one of the prey cells that it sees.
